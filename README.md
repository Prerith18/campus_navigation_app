### Project description: 
Navigating a large campus can be hard for new students, staff, and visitors. This project focuses on developing a mobile app that simplifies campus navigation by providing real-time location tracking, indoor and outdoor maps, and route guidance. Using Flutter for cross-platform development ensures the app works seamlessly on Android devices. Firebase will manage backend tasks such as authentication and real-time data synchronization. Key features include interactive maps, search functionality for campus buildings and facilities, and customizable route options based on user preferences. The app will enhance user experience by reducing the time and effort spent finding locations, supporting accessibility needs, and providing timely campus alerts. This solution aims to make campus navigation intuitive, efficient, and inclusive, ultimately improving everyday campus life.
